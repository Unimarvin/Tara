## Purpose
Given a service and a cost specification, Tara computes the cost-minimal partners of this service. Thereby, Tara cooperates with Wendy and LoLA. 

## Authors
Jan SÃ¼rmeli developed the core algorithms in Tara.
Marvin Triebel implemented Tara and provided optimizations for the core algorithms.

## Dependencies

Please note that Tara depends on the tools *Wendy* and *Lola*, which can be found here:
