[EXIT STATUS]
Hello exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information. Note that the exit code is not correlated to the controllability result.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the

from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP

.I hello.conf
together with a description of the problem to
